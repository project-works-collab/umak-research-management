# Requirement-to-artifact completion checklist

Updated 5 October 2026. **Verified** identifies an executed check or inspected artifact, not instructor acceptance. **Documented proposal** means designed but not operationally verified. **External action required** cannot be supplied by automated work. **Needs correction** is reserved for an identified unresolved artifact defect. No known repository correction is intentionally left open; external requirements below remain incomplete.

Page numbers are the PDF page numbers before the appended deck. Slide numbers are deck-local (1–14). IAS has 18 report + 14 deck pages; ALGOCOM has 9 + 14.

Prior integration: [PR #3](https://github.com/a-a123456789/umak-research-management/pull/3), merged as `bbe0a73`. Current correction evidence and its exact checked commit are linked in `evidence/corrections/README.md`; do not use an old run as proof of newer edits.

## Submission boundary

No frontend or production deployment is included. SSO, Redis, uploads, Turnitin, immutable offsite backup, production TLS, approved retention and external audit storage remain proposed. Empirical valuation is incomplete. Local native PostgreSQL and CI service containers support the evidence; a teammate must independently exercise Docker Compose. Private-repository native secret scanning/push protection was unavailable; hooks and Gitleaks CI are separate controls. Keep the repository private. Use `docs/team/NEXT_STEPS.md` for member commands, evidence and the unsent team note. Use `docs/team/FINANCIAL_EVIDENCE_WORKSHEET.md` for the unsent instructor clarification.
