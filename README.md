# UMak Center for Research Management — IAS and ALGOCOM PBL

Shared repository for the III-BCSAD bolanatics IAS and ALGOCOM milestones, using one Center for Research Management (CRM) project.

- **IAS:** [Complete security reference](security/README.md) — Express/PostgreSQL controls, privacy workflows, threat models, risk analysis, tests, benchmarks and verification evidence.
- **ALGOCOM:** Independent Python workflow-readiness and DAG critical-path algorithms, correctness tests, synthetic benchmarks and API integration in `algocom/`.
- **Both:** Technical reports, editable presentation decks and final PDFs in `submissions/`; requirement tracking and team handoff in `docs/`.

This is a synthetic-data teaching implementation, not the complete university platform or a production deployment.

Repository: https://github.com/project-works-collab/umak-research-management

## Privacy Policy and Terms

- [Privacy Policy](docs/policies/PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
- [Terms and Conditions](docs/policies/TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md)
- [Sources, implementation mapping and institutional adoption schedule](docs/policies/README.md)

**Final academic submission — proposed policy pending institutional adoption.** These documents describe the CRM project; publishing them does not activate institutional policies, deploy the application or record user acceptance. The unchanged generator exports are preserved separately as source evidence.

## Security assessment reports

Read the [Overall Security Assessment and Remediation Report](OVERALL-SECURITY-ASSESSMENT.md)
for the combined Cloudflare-method and OWASP AST10 results, implemented changes,
CI evidence, and remaining validation work. The original
[application audit](00-INTERIM-SECURITY-AUDIT.md) and
[OWASP assessment](OWASP-AST10-REPORT.md) retain their assessment snapshots.

## Start locally
Requires Python 3.12+, Node 24, npm, Docker Compose (or an existing PostgreSQL 18 instance), and PostgreSQL 18 client tools for the backup exercise.

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node scripts/init-env.js
docker compose up -d --wait
npm run db:setup
npm run hooks:install
npm start
```

For an existing PostgreSQL instance, create an empty `crm_ias` database and update the ignored `.env` URLs before `db:setup`. The setup identity needs permission to create a login role and schema tables. The running API uses the separate non-owner `crm_app` identity. Never use a production database: tests intentionally delete synthetic records. Setup is opt-in through `ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SETUP=yes`.

The API listens on http://127.0.0.1:3000. Synthetic accounts: `student1@example.test`, `student2@example.test`, and `staff@example.test`. Their shared local-only random password is in `.env` under `DEMO_PASSWORD`. Do not publish that file or include it in screenshots.

## Run the evidence checks
```sh
npm run db:setup
npm test
npm run db:setup
npm run demo:sqli
npm run demo:secret
npm run backup:verify
python3 -m pip install -r security/validation/requirements.txt
python3 security/validation/validate_package.py
npm run check:static
```

Tests are sequential and exercise a disposable synthetic database. `db:setup` recreates deleted seed users/records; it does not reset all evidence/history. SQLi demonstration uses a separate temporary schema with fake data and cleans it up. Normal startup never imports the vulnerable code.

CI also runs Gitleaks, Semgrep, npm audit, and model/risk validation. See `evidence/STATUS.md` for what has actually run and what remains pending. Local PostgreSQL 18 and Compose/CI execution are distinct evidence claims.

## API contracts
All nonpublic endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method / route | Input and access |
|---|---|
| GET /health | Public health response |
| POST /api/v1/auth/login | `email`, `password`; returns 15-minute opaque bearer token |
| POST /api/v1/auth/logout | Authenticated; revokes current token |
| POST /api/v1/research/search | Public; `keyword`, optional year/department/limit/offset; typo-tolerant approved records only |
| GET /api/v1/research/:id | Record owner or staff; other records return 404 |
| POST /api/v1/research | Authenticated; `title`, optional `abstract`, `research_year`, `department`; own Draft record |
| POST /api/v1/users/consent | `policy_version: "2026-10-v1"`, `choices: {institutional_analytics: false, email_notifications: false}` |
| POST /api/v1/users/deletion-requests | Student; empty object; requests staff review |
| POST /api/v1/admin/deletion-requests/:id/complete | Staff; `confirm_review: true`; synthetic hard deletion |
| GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs | Staff only; last 100 minimal audit events |

Consultation ticketing and PostgreSQL trigram search are implemented; see [search and scheduling API](docs/SEARCH_AND_CONSULTATIONS.md). Private upload adapters and an Android cache/security library are now implemented; see [IAS implementation](docs/IAS_IMPLEMENTATION.md). No complete frontend, SSO, live cloud deployment or Turnitin integration is claimed.

## Team and submission
Read [team handoff](docs/TEAM_HANDOFF.md), [report corrections](docs/REPORT_CORRECTIONS.md), [privacy behavior](docs/PRIVACY.md), [controls](docs/CONTROLS.md), and [demo instructions](docs/DEMO.md).

Original C-suite roles and writing assignments remain unchanged. Teammates must personally perform their assigned reviews and use their own PRs; initial AI-assisted implementation is not their contribution evidence.

Threat models, financial assumptions and risk data are under `security/`. Threat Dragon 2.6.2 UI import and diagram export have been checked; schema validation alone is not that evidence. Costs and residual risks remain estimates.

Final portfolio: `III-BCSAD_bolanatics_IAS_Capstone_Portfolio.pdf`, including six sections, citations, cross-traceability, AI disclosure and appended 10–14-slide deck. The repository does not replace that PDF.

## AI disclosure
ChatGPT/Codex assisted backend and schema drafting, security tests, isolated demonstrations, CI configuration, document comparison, risk/model integration, and handoff instructions. Actual executed checks are recorded in evidence; team review, institutional verification and final approval remain separate responsibilities.

## ALGOCOM integration

The isolated `algocom/` core now includes DAG duration estimates. Staff can call `POST /api/v1/algorithm/solve`; see [exact contract](docs/ALGORITHM_API.md) and [benchmark method](algocom/README.md). No persistent service-workflow approval is implied.

## Course submissions

Final report PDFs, editable Markdown and 14-slide PowerPoint decks: [submissions](submissions/README.md). See [completion and team handoff](docs/COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md), [current evidence](evidence/STATUS.md), and [algorithm API contract](docs/ALGORITHM_API.md). The shared repository is `project-works-collab/umak-research-management`; `algocom/` remains independent of the IAS database.

Next actions for every member: [concise handoff](docs/NEXT_STEPS.md). Financial evidence remains [external](docs/FINANCIAL_EVIDENCE_WORKSHEET.md).


## Trigram search and consultation scheduling

`db:setup` now applies versioned migrations before seeding. Existing installations
can run `npm run db:migrate` using the owner connection; PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` must
be available. This preserves existing research IDs and Draft/Approved visibility.
Search adds typo matching and optional year/department filters. Staff can review
possible duplicates including drafts. Consultation tickets support deadline order,
atomic claims, versioned rescheduling, resolution and cancellation.

The live queue uses PostgreSQL as its durable authority. An indexed EDF min-heap
is implemented and benchmarked separately; it is not an authoritative per-server
cache. See [API and guarantees](docs/SEARCH_AND_CONSULTATIONS.md) and
[benchmark instructions](benchmarks/README.md). Password hashing, auditing and access controls have since been strengthened; see
[IAS implementation and evidence](docs/IAS_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## IAS confidentiality, integrity and availability update

See [implementation and deployment guide](docs/IAS_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for native RLS, faculty/membership/reviewer scope, feedback isolation, Argon2id, shared throttling, private documents, TLS, encrypted recovery, Android library and evidence commands. Older reports describe their original submission snapshot.
