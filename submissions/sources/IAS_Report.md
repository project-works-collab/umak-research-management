Writing assignments do not alter defense responsibilities. These roles describe the five-student project team; they are not appointments to university offices. No signature, official notification or human review is asserted. One designated member submits the portfolio and repository URL through TBL Hub. Confirm the official deadline separately.

## Executive scope and evidence status

This report consolidates the six laboratory topics around the implemented synthetic CRM backend. It preserves the completed team sections as source material while correcting mismatched project names, stack claims, legal statements, risk assumptions and evidence. CRM means Center for Research Management. “Online Repository Management System” and “UMak-RMLIS” are earlier labels for this course project, not evidence of additional deployed systems [1].

The implementation uses Express/Node 24, PostgreSQL 18, local bearer sessions, Python DAG computation and GitHub Actions. No complete frontend, cloud deployment, Google SSO, Redis, uploads or Turnitin integration is claimed. Production-grade architecture is the design target; the submitted system is a bounded teaching prototype. Production approval depends on institutional policy, HTTPS, operational isolation, retention and human review.

Local checks and integration GitHub CI have executed. Commands, outputs and commit IDs are retained under `evidence/integration/`; exact final merge and protection status belongs to the completion ledger. Financial inputs remain scenario estimates, incident response is an academic simulation, and automated checks are distinct from peer review.

## I. Enterprise governance and asset inventory

### System profile and reporting lines

The system supports approved research discovery, authenticated record creation/read access, optional privacy preferences, reviewed synthetic deletion, and staff-only workflow estimation. Researchers and CRM staff are distinct application roles. Git contributors and database administrators are separate operational identities; being a student CEO does not automatically grant a staff API account or production database access.

Classroom reporting: Lead Engineer and CIO report implementation/recovery evidence to CEO; CISO reports threat priorities and residual risks directly to CEO; DPO independently raises privacy concerns to CEO and the actual institutional authority when appropriate. The CISO can request a release hold for an unresolved severe flaw, while CEO records the project decision. Actual university officers retain institutional authority. This separates budget/scope decisions, technical execution and risk review [2], [3].

CEO owns priorities and risk acceptance; CIO owns environment, backups and architecture accuracy; CISO owns STRIDE, DREAD, register and NIST/ISO alignment; Lead Engineer owns patches, tests and Git configuration; DPO owns legal mapping, data minimization and simulation labeling. A release exception requires a reason, exact affected rule, passing evidence and restoration record. This integration's owner-authorized approval exception is not peer review.

### Asset inventory and classification

The following are stable IDs for actual prototype components and explicitly proposed persistence, not an inventory of real university records. Confidentiality classes apply to intended data; current records are synthetic.

| ID / asset | Custodian / location | Classification | Security priorities |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-01 identities, sessions, consent | Gian / PostgreSQL | Restricted | Confidentiality, authenticity, privacy; prevent impersonation |
| A-02 research records and backups | Justin / operational DB and temporary dump | Confidential; approved metadata public | Confidentiality, integrity, availability, Safety (avoid harmful disclosure or loss) |
| A-03 service-workflow records | John David / proposed persistence adapter | Confidential, proposed | Integrity, privacy, authentic evidence gates |
| A-04 public research information | Justin / approved search response | Public | Integrity and availability; public does not mean writable |
| A-05 credentials | Gian / ignored local environment, ephemeral CI | Restricted | Confidentiality and Safety (avoid harmful disclosure or loss) |
| A-06 source, CI and models | Gian / private Git repository | Internal | Integrity, authenticity and availability |
| A-07 audit events | Aaliyah / logical audit store in PostgreSQL | Confidential | Integrity, accountability and controlled retention |
| A-08 workflow scenarios/results | Gian / bounded worker memory and response | Internal synthetic; future confidential | Integrity, availability and honest estimate interpretation |

CIANA-PS follows the milestone definitions: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Non-Repudiation, Authenticity, Privacy and Safety. Safety means reducing foreseeable harm to researchers from disclosure, corrupted decisions or unavailable services; this prototype is not a safety-critical certified system. Attributable logs support accountability but do not establish cryptographic non-repudiation [2], [4].

| Student / reports to | Routine governance duty | CIANA-PS contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Anjelo, CEO / team and institutional sponsor | Set scope, fund controls, record release decisions | Availability and Safety; authorize residual risk only after review |
| Justin, CIO / CEO | Operate database, backup and recovery | Availability and Integrity |
| Aaliyah, CISO / CEO directly | Assess threats, challenge exceptions, monitor evidence | Confidentiality, Integrity and Non-Repudiation |
| Gian, Lead Engineer / CIO for operations; CEO for delivery | Implement access rules, tests and CI | Authenticity, Integrity and Availability |
| John David, DPO / CEO; independent escalation to institution | Review consent, erasure and incident simulation | Privacy and Confidentiality; Safety of data subjects |

The business data owner decides permitted use and retention; the custodian implements storage and approved access. The student CEO models the owner's project decisions and the CIO models custody, without claiming university appointment. Direct CISO-to-CEO reporting lets unresolved security issues reach the decision maker without being filtered by delivery management [2], [3].

Conflict example: Gian requests a release while a severe authorization defect remains. Aaliyah presents the affected asset and failed test; John David assesses privacy harm; Justin estimates recovery impact; Anjelo records a defer-or-accept decision. Proposed team tolerance: no release with failing mandatory checks, exposed credentials or demonstrated unauthorized disclosure. Financial acceptance thresholds require institutional confirmation. The earlier review-count exception did not waive security checks and did not constitute peer review.

## II. Attack surface, Kill Chain and code remediation

### Actual stack and attack surface

| Entry/component | Asset / failure mode | Implemented control | Evidence / remaining limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Express public search | A-02/A-04 SQL injection, broad result sets | Parameterized query, Approved filter, 100-row cap, 200-character keyword | SQLi demo and regression test; no full penetration test |
| Login/session routes | A-01 brute force, token theft | Salted scrypt, random hashed one-hour bearer token; login/general throttling; revocation | Auth tests; local HTTP requires production HTTPS |
| Record read/create | A-02 object access or forged ownership | Owner-or-staff predicate; server author ID; Draft-only creation | Cross-user denial and staff success tests |
| Consent/deletion | A-01/A-02 forged choices or erasure | Strict fields, server identity/time, staff-reviewed transaction | Privacy tests; backup erasure is proposed |
| Algorithm solve/worker | A-08 DoS, forged evidence scenario | Staff-only, graph limits, two workers, timeout, output cap, fixed script/no shell | Worker/API tests; scenario not institutional verification |
| PostgreSQL | A-01/A-02/A-07 excessive privilege | Separate non-owner runtime; PUBLIC grants revoked; audit INSERT/SELECT only | Permission tests; no RLS or immutable audit system |
| Git and CI | A-05/A-06 committed secrets/supply chain | Local hook, Gitleaks, Semgrep, dependency audit, required checks | Actual hook rejection and CI; native private-repo push protection unavailable |
| Optional external services | Proposed identity/storage/upload features | No active integration or route | Review before enabling; do not claim current attack evidence |

Vulnerability classifications: SQL injection is CWE-89; missing authorization is CWE-862; uncontrolled resource consumption is CWE-400. Parameterization and explicit authorization align with OWASP verification guidance [5], [6]. The isolated vulnerable app is never imported by normal startup.

### Seven-phase Kill Chain with ATT&CK mapping

This seven-stage tabletop targets the existing developer workstation, ignored credentials and PostgreSQL research collection. It assumes a malware operator gains the workstation user's execution rights through a malicious file outside the CRM app. No upload feature, observed intrusion or executed malware is claimed. The sequence is a hypothesis for defense planning; the executed SQLi experiment below is separate. Kill Chain phases and ATT&CK tactics are related but are not interchangeable taxonomies [7], [8].

| Phase | Hypothetical action / ATT&CK ID | Control or limit |
|---|---|---|
| Reconnaissance | Discover exposed routes when the local service is reachable / T1595.002 | Minimal routes; no external reconnaissance performed |
| Weaponization | Prepare a credential-stealing executable / T1587.001 | No malware built; trusted developer tooling is an operational requirement |
| Delivery | Send that file to the developer as a phishing attachment / T1566.001 | Outside CRM ingestion; awareness training proposed |
| Exploitation | Developer executes the malicious file / T1204.002 | Requires user execution, not an imaginary upload/parser flaw |
| Installation | Persist as a user cron job on the Unix host / T1053.003 | OS hardening/monitoring proposed; no persistence installed |
| Command and control | Contact an attacker web service / T1071.001 | Egress monitoring proposed; no connection executed |
| Actions on objectives | Use stolen local admin credentials to encrypt reachable research/backup data / T1486 | Runtime least privilege and synthetic recovery tested; workstation isolation/offsite recovery remain gaps |

### Actual vulnerable and patched proof

The demonstration creates temporary synthetic tables and runs the same UNION payload against the isolated concatenating example and the normal parameterized search. It then removes its temporary schema. The vulnerable result contains a fake credential sentinel; the patched result is HTTP 200 with an empty array. Successful prevention need not return 401 because search itself is public.

Repository vulnerable example (`demo/vulnerable-app.js`, isolated synthetic demonstration):

```javascript
// INTENTIONALLY VULNERABLE: loaded only by scripts/demo-sqli.js in an isolated schema.
import express from 'express';
export function vulnerableApp(db) {
 const app=express();app.use(express.json());
 app.post('/api/v1/research/search',async(req,res)=>{
   const query="SELECT id,title,abstract,status FROM research_records WHERE status='Approved' AND title LIKE '%" + req.body.keyword + "%'";
   const r=await db.query(query);res.json(r.rows);
 });
 return app;
}
```

Normal endpoint query (`src/app.js`):

```javascript
const r=await db.query(
 "SELECT id,title,abstract,status FROM research_records WHERE status='Approved' AND title ILIKE $1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 100",
 ['%'+keyword+'%']);
res.json(r.rows);
```

Same malicious request in both tests:

```http
POST /api/v1/research/search
Content-Type: application/json

{"keyword":"' UNION SELECT id, email, password_hash, role FROM users--"}
```

Recorded server responses from the local synthetic run at commit `655114e`:

```json
{"before":{"status":200,"body":[
 {"id":99,"title":"synthetic@example.test","abstract":"FAKE_HASH_NOT_A_CREDENTIAL","status":"student"},
 {"id":1,"title":"Public synthetic record","abstract":"Public abstract","status":"Approved"}]},
 "after":{"status":200,"body":[]},"result":"PASS"}
```

Actual command: `npm run demo:sqli`. The before/after JSON and PASS assertion are recorded in `evidence/integration/local-checks.txt`. Tests separately check approved-only normal results, cross-user denial, valid staff access and malformed input. The demo proves a specific query control on synthetic data; it does not prove every route or database grant is secure.

## III. Legal compliance, privacy by design and incident response

The following are engineering mappings for academic analysis, not legal certification. The actual institutional DPO must confirm processing purposes, lawful basis, retention and notification decisions. Older statutes and the 2016 NPC circular are deliberately cited using their actual dates [9]–[11].

### Five provisions from each law

| Law / provision | CRM design implication | Control and verification boundary |
|---|---|---|
| RA 10173 §11 | Transparency, legitimate purpose, proportionality | Collect minimal consent fields; privacy notice and retention schedule need institutional confirmation |
| RA 10173 §12 | Establish lawful processing criteria | Optional choices recorded separately; no claim that a checkbox legalizes core processing |
| RA 10173 §13 | Special conditions for sensitive/privileged data | Synthetic data only; real educational/research data classification and authority review required |
| RA 10173 §16 | Data-subject rights including applicable blocking/removal | Reviewed deletion request; real rights workflow/retention exceptions need confirmation |
| RA 10173 §20 | Appropriate organizational, physical and technical safeguards | Tested authorization, session handling and backup recovery; production safeguards remain partly proposed |
| RA 10175 §4(a)(1) | Illegal access risk | Authentication, staff/owner checks, database privilege separation |
| RA 10175 §4(a)(2) | Illegal interception risk | Production TLS required; local HTTP is not protected transport evidence |
| RA 10175 §4(a)(3) | Data interference risk | Parameterized SQL and constrained record writes; audit attribution |
| RA 10175 §4(a)(4) | System interference risk | Body/graph/concurrency/time limits and restoration exercises |
| RA 10175 §4(a)(5) | Misuse of devices risk | Restrict credential/tool access; keep vulnerable demonstration isolated and authorized |

### Consent JSON and API

Authenticated `POST /api/v1/users/consent` accepts exactly `policy_version` and `choices`. The supported version is `2026-10-v1`. Choices are two required booleans; both may be false. Client-supplied user ID or timestamp is rejected. The server records identity from the session and time from PostgreSQL; repeated requests append preference history, with the latest record representing current optional choices.

```
{"policy_version":"2026-10-v1",
 "choices":{"institutional_analytics":false,"email_notifications":false}}
```

HTTP 201 returns `id,user_id,policy_version,choices,recorded_at`; invalid fields/version return 400; missing or invalid session returns 401. No IP address, user agent, real name, email-delivery integration or analytics processing is added by this route. Production must explain purpose, withdrawal, retention and the distinct lawful basis for necessary service processing [9].

### Deletion and backup handling

A student sends `{}` to `POST /api/v1/users/deletion-requests`; HTTP 202 returns request ID, status and server request time. Repeating a pending request reuses it. Only staff can complete `/api/v1/admin/deletion-requests/:id/complete` with `{"confirm_review":true}`. The transaction deletes the synthetic user and cascades research records, sessions and consents; the request loses its personal user link and a minimal staff-attributed audit event remains. Completion returns a warning that backup erasure is not implemented.

Soft deletion only hides records. Hard deletion removes operational rows but does not erase historical backups. Proposed production procedure: confirm authority/holds; erase eligible data; maintain a restricted deletion ledger outside backups; expire recovery copies on an approved retention schedule; replay deletion events after restoration before opening traffic; review audit retention and minimize retained identifiers. Cryptographic shredding requires per-subject encryption keys and verified destruction of all recoverable copies; no KMS or shredding implementation is claimed.

### Proposed production erasure design — not implemented

| Method | Live data | Historical backups | Decision / verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soft deletion | Hidden, recoverable rows | Unchanged | Useful for review/holds; not erasure |
| Hard deletion | Operational rows removed | Old copies remain readable | Current prototype behavior; restore must replay authorized deletions |
| Cryptographic erasure | Encrypted personal fields unreadable after key destruction | Effective only if every recoverable subject key is destroyed | Proposed architecture; not claimed for current plaintext fields |

Proposed sequence: (1) authenticate the requester and record the lawful decision and any required hold; (2) locate subject data across tables, exports, caches and backups; (3) remove eligible live rows and minimize retained audit identifiers; (4) record a restricted deletion event outside routine backup snapshots; (5) quarantine each restore and replay those events before reopening access; (6) expire backup generations on an institution-approved schedule and document verification. No arbitrary retention period is asserted [9], [17].

For a future encryption design, encrypt each subject's fields with a distinct data-encryption key and keep recoverable subject keys in a separately governed key service, not inside the database dump. Destroy all key versions, replicas, escrow and recoverable backups for an approved subject deletion; verify that restored ciphertext cannot be decrypted. Shared keys cannot selectively erase one person's records. Cryptographic erasure does not remove plaintext exports, logs or prior copies: those need separate sanitization and evidence. This design needs implementation, key inventory and recovery tests before a permanent-erasure claim [16]. Required financial/audit retention must be established by the institution; retain only necessary records under that authority, not a blanket exception [17].

### Six-stage incident response — academic simulation

Scenario: a synthetic alert suggests unauthorized research disclosure. No actual university incident, affected-person count, containment action or notification is asserted. The six stages below are a rehearsal playbook; production timing and responsibility must be adopted by the real institution [11], [12].

| Stage | Owner and action | Evidence to produce in a real incident |
|---|---|---|
| Identify | CISO triages alert; DPO assesses personal-data exposure | Record discovery time, source, confidence and known unknowns |
| Contain | CIO/Engineer restrict affected route and revoke compromised sessions/credentials | Preserve logs before destructive changes; record scope and containment time |
| Analyze | CISO/Engineer correlate authorized logs and changes | Identify affected data, access path and uncertainty; preserve chain of custody |
| Eradicate | Engineer patches root cause and rotates affected credentials | Reviewed fix, dependency review and repeated exploit test |
| Recover | CIO restores verified copies and checks integrity | Replay approved deletions before traffic; compare records and monitor recurrence |
| Lessons learned | CEO convenes CISO/DPO/team | Update policies, threat model, backlog and training; document accountable follow-up |

NPC notification is not triggered by every security event. Assess the legally specified breach conditions and, when notification is required, the 72-hour requirement runs from knowledge or reasonable belief as specified in the applicable rules. Uncertainty must be communicated and updated, not replaced with invented facts [11].

### Draft NPC notice — ACADEMIC INCIDENT SIMULATION, NOT SUBMITTED

To: National Privacy Commission (submission channel to be verified by actual institutional DPO). Reporting controller: [actual institution and authorized contact to be confirmed]. Discovery time: [unknown; enter verified time]. Nature: suspected unauthorized disclosure of research-related personal data. Data and individuals affected: [categories/count unknown pending investigation]. Likely consequences: [assessed risks, not assumed actual harm]. Containment and recovery: [verified actions/times only]. Measures for affected people: [reviewed guidance]. Notification basis and timing: [DPO assessment and evidence]. Next update: [authorized schedule]. No signatory or official appointment is fabricated. This template must not be sent as an actual incident report.

## IV. EISP, system policy and Git guardrails

### Five-part Enterprise Information Security Policy charter

1. Executive Philosophy: protect research participants, trustworthy records and service continuity. Proposed risk tolerance prohibits release with failing mandatory checks, exposed credentials or demonstrated unauthorized disclosure; institutional risk acceptance is separate.
2. Scope of Application: cover team devices, source, CI, the synthetic Express/PostgreSQL service, Python worker, local backups and submitted documentation. University production adoption is not asserted.
3. Roles and Responsibilities: CEO records decisions; CIO operates infrastructure; CISO evaluates threats and exceptions; Lead Engineer implements and tests; DPO reviews privacy. Follow the reporting table in Section I.
4. Statutory Directives: assess RA 10173 and RA 10175 obligations using the mappings in Section III [9], [10]; use ISO/IEC 27001:2022 for a proposed governance roadmap, not a certification claim [3]. Default deny, least privilege, secret exclusion and tested recovery are team requirements.
5. Administrative Review Cadence: review at each milestone, after material architecture changes and after incidents. Record exception owner, reason, expiry and compensating checks. Monthly access review is proposed; no completed meeting or invented disciplinary sanction is asserted.

### Managerial policy

Changes require an identifiable author, linked risk/ticket, passing checks and normal peer review. The project owner may authorize a documented one-time review exception with restoration; passing CI is not peer approval. Production processing, hosting and retention changes require the actual institutional authority. Monthly classroom access reviews and per-release recovery rehearsal are proposed operating routines, not claims of completed meetings.

### Five-column default-deny ACL

| Subject | Resource / action | Decision | Condition | Enforcement / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anonymous | Health; approved research search | Allow read | Valid bounded keyword; Approved only; max 100 rows | Express public routes and search tests |
| Anonymous | Private records, consent, solver, audit | Deny | No valid session | 401 assertions |
| Student | Own record read / own Draft creation | Allow | Authenticated identity; server ownership | SQL owner predicate and creation tests |
| Student | Another owner's private record / staff route | Deny | No ownership/staff grant | 404 object hiding / 403 staff denial |
| Student | Own consent / deletion request | Allow | Valid body, policy and session | Privacy tests and server identity |
| Staff | Record reads, audit reads, reviewed deletion | Allow | Staff role; explicit deletion confirmation | Staff middleware and transaction tests |
| Staff | Algorithm scenario solve | Allow | Strict graph/body bounds; worker admission | Algorithm API and failure tests |
| Runtime DB role | Operational queries; audit INSERT/SELECT | Allow scoped grants | Non-owner authenticated DB connection | Schema grants and DB permission tests |
| Runtime DB role | Audit UPDATE/DELETE; schema DROP | Deny | Never granted | SQLSTATE 42501 assertions |
| Any unlisted subject/action | Any resource | Deny | No explicit rule | Route 404, middleware and revoked PUBLIC privileges |

Working configuration lives in `src/app.js`, `src/algorithm.js`, `db/schema.sql`, `compose.yaml`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.gitleaks.toml`, `.semgrep.yml` and GitHub workflows. The local HTTP binding is loopback; deployment TLS and network controls are not inferred from a diagram [13].

### Comparative framework roadmap

| Phase / owner | NIST CSF 2.0 alignment | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 alignment | Concrete deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Define / CEO+CISO | Govern, Identify | Clauses 4–6 context, leadership, planning | Scope, asset owners, risk register and acceptance criteria |
| Implement / CIO+Engineer | Protect, Detect | Clause 8 operation; selected Annex A controls | Access/configuration rules, secure development checks, attributable logs |
| Rehearse / CIO+DPO | Respond, Recover | Operational response and continuity controls | Synthetic playbook, restore evidence, breach assessment template |
| Evaluate / CISO+CEO | Govern and improvement across functions | Clauses 9–10 evaluation and improvement | Review metrics, residual-risk decisions and corrective backlog |

NIST supplies a flexible outcomes vocabulary; ISO 27001 specifies an auditable management-system requirement set. This mapping is a project roadmap, not ISO certification or a completed NIST assessment [2], [3].

### Three-tier SETA plan

Awareness, all users: brief secret/privacy and receipt-versus-verification reminders at onboarding and monthly; measure completion and a short quiz. Training, developers/staff: per-release practice of access-control tests, incident triage and restore rehearsal; require execution evidence. Education, project leaders: each milestone discuss risk math, legal duties and framework tradeoffs; use oral scenario defense. These are scheduled proposals; do not invent attendance records.

### Git rulebook and exception

Use feature branches and pull requests. Keep `.env`, dumps, raw credentials and production personal data out of Git. Install the hook with `npm run hooks:install`; local hooks can be bypassed, so Gitleaks CI provides a second check. Required CI includes dependency audit, static analysis, security tests, model/risk consistency and ALGOCOM correctness/performance. Normal main policy requires two approvals, stale-review dismissal, a reviewer other than the last pusher, passing `security` and `algocom` checks, linear history and resolved conversations. No force pushes or deletion.

Integration uses the owner's explicitly authorized approval exception: only review requirements are temporarily relaxed after passing checks; restoration is attempted in a finally path and verified. The exact applied state is recorded in the merge ledger. Native GitHub secret scanning/push protection returned unavailable for this private account/repository; do not claim those features were enabled. Privacy remains private unless separately authorized.

## V. Asset valuation, TVA and quantitative risk

### Four-attribute profile and valuation basis

A-02 is the research-record collection. Business owner: project CEO representing the proposed CRM service; technical custodian: CIO; location: PostgreSQL and temporary recovery copies; classification/criticality: confidential unpublished records with high integrity and availability needs. Existing approved metadata is public. No real university record inventory or incident-loss dataset was supplied.

Retained Lab 5 scenario AV=PHP 3,600,000: engineering/reconstruction 920,000; operational interruption 800,000; response/legal/penalty contingency 1,880,000. These are planning estimates, not invoices, fines, statutory penalty calculations, observed university losses or empirical valuation evidence. The contingency is particularly uncertain. Obtain institutional estimates or documented quotations before budget approval [1], [4].

### Five categories and eleven TVA triples

Each row is an explicit threat-agent / vulnerability / asset combination. Five categories have at least two triples; the eleventh adds audit repudiation. Controls are updated to the actual prototype or clearly proposed scope.

| TVA / category | Agent | Vulnerability / status | Asset |
|---|---|---|---|
| TVA-01 / Software attacks | External web attacker | The isolated demonstration concatenates SQL; the normal route uses bound parameters. Demonstrated in isolated vulnerable example; mitigated in normal application. | A-02 |
| TVA-02 / Software attacks | Authenticated peer | Omitting per-record authorization would expose another user record; current predicates reject that access. Mitigated scenario; owner/staff checks tested. | A-02 |
| TVA-03 / Human error or failure | Deployment administrator | Temporary pg_dump copies are not encrypted by the application; a local user able to read them can recover records. Current residual risk; no application-level dump encryption. | A-02 |
| TVA-04 / Human error or failure | Developer mistake then external attacker | Accidental committed credentials can be copied from Git history; hooks can be bypassed, so CI is independently required. Mitigated scenario; fake-secret rejection and CI verified. | A-05; A-02 |
| TVA-05 / Espionage or trespass | Authenticated peer exploiting another query flaw | Runtime role can select multiple users rows; application predicates are the isolation boundary and a future missed query could bypass it. Current residual risk; runtime role is not row-isolated. | A-02 |
| TVA-06 / Espionage or trespass | Network observer or session thief | Local HTTP carries bearer credentials without TLS; deployment on an untrusted network would expose them. Current transport limitation; local HTTP only. | A-01; A-02 |
| TVA-07 / Information extortion | Ransomware operator | Backup exercise has no independent immutable recovery generation; compromise of the same operator host may destroy both data and reachable copies. Current recovery design gap; extortion is a hypothetical scenario. | A-02 |
| TVA-08 / Information extortion | Ransomware operator with credentials or DB exploit | A stolen administrator credential can alter research data; runtime restriction does not constrain the separately privileged setup identity. Current privileged-account threat scenario; compromise not demonstrated. | A-02 |
| TVA-09 / Sabotage or vandalism | Abusive client | Without bounds, search and graph processing can exhaust resources; current route caps and worker lifecycle limits mitigate that case. Mitigated resource scenario; OS/distributed limits remain. | A-02; A-04; A-08 |
| TVA-10 / Sabotage or vandalism | Compromised or faulty worker process | Status-only worker validation accepted incomplete SUCCESS objects before correction. Demonstrated boundary defect; corrected and regression tested. | A-08 |
| TVA-11 / Sabotage or vandalism | Malicious database administrator | Runtime audit grants prevent modification, but the database owner can still alter or delete audit events. Current residual risk; administrator can alter audit history. | A-07; A-02 |

These are eleven assessed scenarios across five categories, not eleven currently exploitable defects. The before-fix worker boundary and isolated SQLi have executable reproductions; other rows are mitigated scenarios or explicitly described residual risks. Future uploads, HTML rendering and cloud buckets are excluded from this count. DREAD and financial allocations remain analyst estimates and require team review.

### SLE, ALE, safeguard cost and CBA

The scenario follows the course risk arithmetic [4]: SLE=AV×EF; ALE=SLE×ARO; CBA=ALE_before−ALE_after−ACS. Use EF=0.40, prior ARO=2/year, target ARO=0.05/year, annual safeguard cost ACS=PHP 240,000. Thus SLE=1,440,000; prior ALE=2,880,000; target ALE=72,000; CBA=2,568,000; illustrative return on security investment=(2,808,000−240,000)/240,000=1,070%.

This positive result is conditional on the unverified frequency and effectiveness estimates. It is not measured savings or proof that safeguards reduce real incidents to 0.05/year. Do not sum the eleven risk rows' costs again: their allocations partition the same PHP 240,000 bundle. Avoid adding correlated breach losses as if independent.

| Sensitivity scenario | AV / EF / ARO before→after | ACS (PHP) | CBA (PHP/year) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retained planning case | 3.6m / .40 / 2→.05 | 240,000 | 2,568,000 |
| Lower loss and frequency | 1.8m / .20 / .20→.10 | 240,000 | -204,000 |
| Less effective safeguards | 3.6m / .40 / 2→1.5 | 360,000 | 360,000 |

Break-even ARO reduction at the base SLE is 240,000/1,440,000=0.1667 events/year. Negative CBA in the low-loss case shows why measured valuation and likelihood inputs matter. Legal/ethical obligations can still require controls even when a narrow monetary calculation is negative.

### Nine-column Enterprise Risk Register

Likelihood and impact use ordinal 1–5 project scales; product is a prioritization score, not a probability. Target residual scores are planning assumptions, not validated post-deployment rates. DREAD uses a separate 1–10 scale in Section VI. Risk acceptance remains with the designated project owner after actual review.

| Risk ID | Asset | Agent | Root cause | Score | Treatment | Countermeasure | PHP/year | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | A-02 | External web attacker | The isolated demonstration concatenates SQL; the normal route uses bound parameters. | 20 | Mitigate | Parameterized search and publication filtering; synthetic exploit comparison and regression tests pass. | 44,000 | 5 |
| R-02 | A-02 | Authenticated peer | Omitting per-record authorization would expose another user record; current predicates reject that access. | 16 | Mitigate | Owner-or-staff predicates on records; default denial; cross-user tests pass. Collaborator grants are not implemented. | 25,000 | 4 |
| R-03 | A-02 | Deployment administrator | Temporary pg_dump copies are not encrypted by the application; a local user able to read them can recover records. | 12 | Mitigate | Temporary-directory cleanup and controlled operator access; application backup encryption and custody evidence remain proposed. | 15,000 | 4 |
| R-04 | A-05; A-02 | Developer mistake then external attacker | Accidental committed credentials can be copied from Git history; hooks can be bypassed, so CI is independently required. | 20 | Mitigate | Pre-commit rejection, Gitleaks CI and protected branches; rotate any real leaked credential. Native private-repo push protection unavailable. | 35,000 | 5 |
| R-05 | A-02 | Authenticated peer exploiting another query flaw | Runtime role can select multiple users rows; application predicates are the isolation boundary and a future missed query could bypass it. | 12 | Mitigate | Non-owner runtime and tested application predicates; RLS not implemented. | 18,000 | 4 |
| R-06 | A-01; A-02 | Network observer or session thief | Local HTTP carries bearer credentials without TLS; deployment on an untrusted network would expose them. | 12 | Mitigate | Hashed expiring bearer sessions and revocation; local HTTP only. Production HTTPS remains required. No cookie authentication. | 8,000 | 4 |
| R-07 | A-02 | Ransomware operator | Backup exercise has no independent immutable recovery generation; compromise of the same operator host may destroy both data and reachable copies. | 15 | Mitigate | Verified local restore is a prerequisite, not offsite resilience. Proposed immutable independent recovery, segregated credentials and rehearsed incident recovery. | 16,000 | 5 |
| R-08 | A-02 | Ransomware operator with credentials or DB exploit | A stolen administrator credential can alter research data; runtime restriction does not constrain the separately privileged setup identity. | 20 | Mitigate | Separate non-owner runtime, loopback DB and tested restore; protect setup credentials and add independent immutable backups before production. | 48,000 | 5 |
| R-09 | A-02; A-04; A-08 | Abusive client | Without bounds, search and graph processing can exhaust resources; current route caps and worker lifecycle limits mitigate that case. | 12 | Mitigate | Rate/body limits; staff-only solver; 5000 steps, 25000 edges, 50000 memberships, 2 MiB body; two Python workers, five-second timeout, 8 MiB output ceiling. No OS memory sandbox. | 12,000 | 6 |
| R-10 | A-08 | Compromised or faulty worker process | Status-only worker validation accepted incomplete SUCCESS objects before correction. | 12 | Mitigate | Full structural/type/membership validation; malformed object yields WORKER_PROTOCOL/502; worker process is bounded. | 12,000 | 4 |
| R-11 | A-07; A-02 | Malicious database administrator | Runtime audit grants prevent modification, but the database owner can still alter or delete audit events. | 12 | Mitigate | Runtime INSERT/SELECT-only audit grants tested; external tamper-resistant audit storage and administrator oversight remain proposed. | 7,000 | 4 |

Residual scores are targets, not measured post-control frequencies.

## VI. Threat Dragon, STRIDE/DREAD and mitigation tickets

### Data flows and trust boundaries

`security/models/CRM_Threat_Dragon.json` is the editable Threat Dragon v2 model, with Level 0 context and Level 1 components. Level 0 has one CRM process. Level 1 separates Express routing, authentication, research/privacy, audit, CI, backup administration and Python worker; logical D-01 operational tables and D-02 audit storage share PostgreSQL but have different grants. D-03 is temporary local backup storage. Identity provider and release/cloud extensions are explicitly proposed [14].

TB-01 crosses client to API; TB-02 is the authorization boundary inside Express, not a separate subnet; TB-03 crosses application to database; TB-04 crosses into the Python child process, not an OS sandbox. DF-14 carries scenario/result JSON over local pipes; it carries no database credentials. P-06 backup reads with a separate administrator identity and writes a temporary dump. Local HTTP and database TCP are not represented as encrypted production transport.

The model passes structural/schema and eleven-threat mapping checks. Current model-derived SVG diagrams accompany this report; both diagrams opened in Threat Dragon 2.6.2. The rendered SVG assets were exported from the browser; raw copies and page-sized copies accompany the model. These are distinct from schema validation and the separately generated report review drawings.

### STRIDE and DREAD

STRIDE guides threat discovery across spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service and elevation of privilege [14]. DREAD is a classroom heuristic: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability are each scored 1–10 and averaged. Ratings are analyst assumptions, not measured attack probabilities or a standardized risk certification. High is at least 7, medium is 4–6.9, low is below 4 for this project.

| Threat / element | STRIDE | D,R,E,A,D | Mean | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| THREAT-01 SQL injection / P-03 | Tampering; Information disclosure | 9,9,8,10,8 | 8.8 | Demonstrated in isolated vulnerable example; mitigated in normal application |
| THREAT-02 Object authorization bypass / P-03 | Information disclosure; Elevation of privilege | 8,9,8,7,8 | 8.0 | Mitigated scenario; owner/staff checks tested |
| THREAT-03 Backup confidentiality exposure / D-03 | Information disclosure | 8,9,7,7,7 | 7.6 | Current residual risk; no application-level dump encryption |
| THREAT-04 Committed credentials / E-04 | Spoofing; Information disclosure; Elevation of privilege | 10,9,8,10,8 | 9.0 | Mitigated scenario; fake-secret rejection and CI verified |
| THREAT-05 Missing database isolation / D-01 | Information disclosure; Elevation of privilege | 7,7,5,7,5 | 6.2 | Current residual risk; runtime role is not row-isolated |
| THREAT-06 Session interception / DF-01 | Spoofing; Information disclosure | 7,6,5,6,6 | 6.0 | Current transport limitation; local HTTP only |
| THREAT-07 Loss of recovery copies under extortion / D-03 | Tampering; Elevation of privilege | 9,7,5,8,6 | 7.0 | Current recovery design gap; extortion is a hypothetical scenario |
| THREAT-08 Database extortion / D-01 | Denial of service; Tampering; Information disclosure | 10,8,7,10,8 | 8.6 | Current privileged-account threat scenario; compromise not demonstrated |
| THREAT-09 Resource exhaustion / P-01 | Denial of service | 7,9,8,8,6 | 7.6 | Mitigated resource scenario; OS/distributed limits remain |
| THREAT-10 Malformed worker certificate / P-07 | Tampering | 7,8,6,6,6 | 6.6 | Demonstrated boundary defect; corrected and regression tested |
| THREAT-11 Unattributable record changes / D-02 | Repudiation; Tampering | 7,7,6,6,6 | 6.4 | Current residual risk; administrator can alter audit history |

Scores retained as planning assumptions; changed scenario wording requires human reassessment before risk acceptance. Highest priorities remain THREAT-04 (9.0), THREAT-01 (8.8), THREAT-08 (8.6).

![AND/OR disclosure attack tree](../figures/Attack_Tree_Current.png)

Root: disclose confidential research records. OR branches: SQL injection; credential abuse; local backup disclosure. SQLi is an AND of a vulnerable concatenated query and sufficient query/table privileges. Credential abuse is an AND of obtaining a usable credential, reaching its service and having sufficient permissions. Local backup disclosure is an AND of an exported private copy and unintended local read access. These are alternative prerequisite paths, not claims that every branch is currently exploitable [15].

Leaf metrics are scenario estimates: query flaw DREAD 8.8; usable credential exposure 9.0; local backup exposure 7.6; reachability/privilege prerequisites assessed jointly, not independently multiplied. “AND” requires all child conditions; “OR” needs any complete branch. The patch removes the demonstrated concatenation condition; secret scanning reduces accidental exposure but cannot prove all credentials safe; no public backup route is implemented; local dump confidentiality still needs operational controls. The editable tree source and image accompany the model.

### Top three agile mitigation tickets

| Ticket / owner | User story and implementation | Automated assertion / evidence | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-04 / Gian | As custodian, prevent accidental credential commits. Install hook, run Gitleaks CI, protect main, document rotation. | `demo:secret` creates fake credential in temp repo and asserts nonzero commit rejection; CI secret scan passes. | Native push protection unavailable; no real compromised credential rotation invented; Aaliyah reviews |
| SEC-01 / Gian | As researcher, keep private data out of public search. Bind SQL values, filter publication, limit results. | Same UNION payload yields fake sentinel only in isolated vulnerable app; normal response 200/[]; large result set capped at 100. | Broader application penetration review remains |
| SEC-08 / Justin | As service owner, recover synthetic records without runtime admin privilege. Separate roles, bind DB locally, restore to disposable DB. | pg_dump/pg_restore compares full ordered rows in six tables; runtime audit alteration/drop returns 42501. | Offsite immutable/encrypted backup, deletion replay and production RPO/RTO not validated |

Traceability is maintained from asset → TVA → threat → risk → control → ticket → source/test/evidence. `security/data/traceability.csv` and the completion checklist provide exact artifact paths. SEC-09 links A-08/THREAT-09 to worker limits and algorithm tests. Three implementation tickets can be locally tested without pretending the real institution accepted residual risk.

## Financial evidence worksheet — external action required

No actual cost records or instructor approval of estimates have been supplied. Aaliyah owns completion; the proposed figures above must not be described as empirical institutional valuation.

| Input | Required source | Actual value / evidence | Reviewer / date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Replacement effort | Logged work hours and supported labor rate | Not supplied | Unsigned |
| Service interruption | Documented affected volume and measured downtime | Not supplied | Unsigned |
| Response and privacy cost | Quote, invoice or approved cost basis | Not supplied | Unsigned |
| Safeguard annual cost | Tool quote and staff-maintenance estimate basis | Not supplied | Unsigned |
| Exposure and event frequency | Incident data or explicitly approved scenario assumptions | Not supplied | Unsigned |
| Estimate exception | Instructor decision with date and permitted scope | Not supplied | Unsigned |

Use `docs/team/FINANCIAL_EVIDENCE_WORKSHEET.md` to record sources and the draft clarification. An instructor decision cannot be assumed and would not turn estimates into observed costs.

## Demonstration, verification and remaining decisions

The 60-second real terminal capture is `evidence/integration/secret-demo.cast`, with a standalone replay in `secret-demo.html`. It uses a deliberately fake secret in a temporary repository; nothing secret is pushed. Speaking script: 0–8s introduce A-05 and THREAT-04; 8–35s run and explain rejection; 35–50s connect the hook and Gitleaks to SEC-04; 50–60s state the limit: hooks can be bypassed and human review/credential rotation remain separate. The replay is an actual timed terminal capture, not a recording of a team member speaking.

Executed checks include authentication/ownership/privacy and DB grants, solver errors and equivalent results, SQLi before/after, secret rejection, synthetic restoration, static checks, dependency audit and model arithmetic/schema validation. GitHub runs Gitleaks and Semgrep in addition to local invariants. Refer to commit-bound logs; do not label a check passed merely because its script exists.

Remaining external decisions: actual staff/institutional confirmation of procedures, retention and financial estimates; teammate understanding and review; institutional production authorization; instructor acceptance; designated TBL Hub submission. No invented dates, appointments or signatures fill these gaps.

## AI collaboration and tool disclosure

ChatGPT/Codex assisted source reconciliation, substantial backend/worker and test drafting, threat/risk refinement, financial checks, diagram/report assembly and CI/evidence packaging. Claude assistance disclosed in the supplied sections is retained. Verification used executed tests, equivalent-baseline comparisons, arithmetic/schema checks, source checks and rendered-page inspection. Automated verification is distinct from human review; the team must validate assumptions and defend the final work.
